         <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
                C++ supports object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for the creation of modular and reusable code.</li>
            <li> Low-Level Memory Manipulation:
                C++ provides facilities for low-level memory manipulation, making it suitable for system programming and applications requiring high performance.</li>
            <li> Low-Level Memory Manipulation:
                C++ provides facilities for low-level memory manipulation, making it suitable for system programming and applications requiring high performance.</li>
            <li>Standard Template Library (STL):
                C++ includes the Standard Template Library, which provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms.</li>
            <li> Case Sensitivity:
                C++ is a case-sensitive language, meaning that identifiers such as variable names and function names are distinguished by their capitalization.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Application of C++:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>System Software Development:

         <section id="third">
         <h2>Introduction to Array:</h2>
         <h3>What is an array?</h3>
         <p>An array is a collection of items or data organized in rows and columns. Arrays are used in coding and programming to store multiple values of the same type. They are also used in math to represent multiplication and division. 
            </p>

            <h3>Characteristics of an array in programming: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The size of an array is determined at the time of its declaration and cannot be changed during runtime.
                </li>
                <li>All elements of an array must be of the same data type (e.g., integers, floats, or characters).

            <h3>Types of arrays commonly used in programming:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> One dimensional Array:- A one-dimensional array is a collection of elements that are stored in a contiguous block of memory and accessed using a single index. It is like a list of values arranged in a linear order.</li>
                <li>Two-Dimensional Array:-	A 2D array where most of the elements are zero, often used in optimization scenarios.
                    •	Example: A matrix with only a few non-zero elements.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Array:-Size can be modified during runtime (with dynamic memory allocation).
                    •	Example in C (using malloc)</li>

        <!-- Tree -->
         <section id="fourth">
        <h2>Introduction to Tree:</h2>
        <h3>What is an tree?</h3>
        <p>A tree is a widely used data structure in computer science that represents hierarchical relationships between elements. It consists of nodes connected by edges, forming a structure that resembles an inverted tree in nature.
           </p> 
           <img src="./tree copy.jpg" alt="tree picture">
           <h3>Characteristics of tree in programming: </h3>
           <ul>
               <li>Hierarchical Structure: Trees represent data in a hierarchy, with a single root node and multiple levels of child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship. 
               </li>
               <li>Non-linear Data Structure: Unlike arrays or linked lists, trees are non-linear, allowing for more complex relationships between data elements. 
               </li>
               <li>Acyclic Nature: Trees do not contain cycles; there is exactly one path between any two nodes, ensuring a clear and unambiguous structure.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Types of tree commonly used in programming:</h3>
           <ol>
               <li> Binary Tree
                Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. Binary trees are foundational structures used in various applications, including expression parsing and binary heaps.</li>
               <li>Binary Search Tree (BST)
                A binary tree where the left childs value is less than the parents, and the right childs value is greater. BSTs facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.</li>
               <li>AVL Tree
                A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is at most one for all nodes. This balance ensures O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.</li>
           </ol>
           <h3>Application of tree:</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>File Systems:-
                Operating systems utilize trees to represent the hierarchical structure of directories and files, allowing efficient navigation and organization.</li>
            <li>Database Indexing:-
                Trees, such as B-trees, are employed in databases to index data, enabling quick search, insertion, and deletion operations.</li>
            <li>Parsing Expressions:-
                Compilers and interpreters use abstract syntax trees to represent the syntactic structure of source code, facilitating efficient parsing and analysis.</li>

        <h2>Introduction to Graph</h2>
        <h3>What is an Graph</h3>
        <p>Graphs are versatile structures used to represent various real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and web page linkages. They are fundamental in computer science for modeling complex relationships and are utilized in numerous algorithms and applications
           </p> 
           <img src="./grapgh copy.jpg" alt="grapgh picture">
           <h3>characteristics of graph in programming: </h3>
           <ul>
               <li> Vertices(Nodes):-A vertex (plural: vertices) is a fundamental unit of a graph, representing an individual entity or object. 
               </li>
               <li>Edges:- An edge (also known as a link) is a fundamental component that connects two vertices (nodes) within a graph. Edges represent the relationships or interactions between the entities that the vertices symbolize.
 
               </li>
               <li>Path:-A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where each edge is distinct, and each vertex is visited at most once. This concept is fundamental for analyzing connectivity and traversability within graphs.</li>
               <li>	Cycle:- A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all other vertices distinct.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Types of graph commonly used in programming:</h3>
           <ol>
               <li>Directed Graph (Diagraph):-A directed graph is a type of graph where each edge has a specific direction, indicating a one-way relationship between two vertices. In such graphs, edges are represented as ordered pairs of vertices, often depicted as arrows pointing from one vertex to another. </li>
               <li>Undirected Graph:-An undirected graph is a type of graph where the edges have no direction, indicating a bidirectional relationship between the connected vertices. In such graphs, an edge between two vertices  u  and  v  is represented as an unordered pair  \{u, v\} , signifying that the connection between  u  and  v  is mutual.</li>
               <li>Weighted Graph:-A weighted graph is a type of graph in which each edge is assigned a numerical value, known as a weight. These weights often represent costs, distances, or capacities, depending on the context. In a weighted graph, an edge between two vertices  u  and  v  is represented as an ordered pair  (u, v)  along with a weight  w(u, v) , indicating the value associated with that edge.</li>
               <li>Unweighted Graph:-An unweighted graph is a type of graph where all edges are considered equal, meaning they do not have any associated weights or costs. In such graphs, the primary concern is whether a connection exists between two vertices, rather than the strength or cost of that connection.</li>
               <li> Cyclic Graph:-A cyclic graph is a graph that contains at least one cycle—a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all other vertices distinct. In other words, its a graph where you can traverse a sequence of edges and return to the starting point without retracing any edge.</li>
               <li>Acyclic Graph:-An Acyclic Graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles, meaning there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex without retracing any edge. This property is fundamental in various fields, particularly in computer science and mathematics, as it ensures a one-way progression without loops.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <h3>Application of Graph</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Network Routing:- Graphs represent networks where nodes are routers or switches, and edges are communication links. Algorithms like Dijkstras and Bellman-Ford are used to find the shortest paths for data transmission.</li>
            <li>Web Page Linkages:- The World Wide Web is modeled as a graph where web pages are nodes, and hyperlinks are edges. This structure is fundamental for search engine algorithms that rank pages based on link analysis.</li>
            <li>Social Networks: Platforms like Facebook and Twitter use graphs to represent users (nodes) and their relationships (edges), enabling features like friend suggestions and community detection.
            </li>
            <li>Route Planning:- Graphs model transportation systems where intersections are nodes, and roads are edges. Algorithms like the A* algorithm are used to find the shortest or fastest routes.</li>
           </ul>
